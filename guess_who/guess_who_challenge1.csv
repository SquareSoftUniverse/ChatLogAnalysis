He calls her over and says: ""There's a really big tip in it for you if you help me play a joke on my friend. I'm going to ask you a question and you just have to answer `one-third x3'."" ""One Thir Dex Cubd?"" she responds. That's right, says the second mathematician, and she walks off muttering ""one thir dex cubd"" under her breath. The first mathematician returns from the restroom. The second mathematician says: ""In light of our previous conversation, I propose the following wager. See that waitress over there?"" ""The gorgeous built blond one?"" ""Yes, that's right. I'll bet you the next round of drinks that she can answer a basic calculus question."" ""Her? No way. You're on.""
